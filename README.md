# Tomasulo-with-speculation
Tomasulo's algorithm with speculation implementation in C++

# Implementation

Tomasuloâ€™s algorithm with speculation has five main stages where these stages are: fetch, issue, execute, writeback, commit. I implemented five main driver functions for each stage handling each aspect in this dual issue pipeline. The input for the whole program is received from an input file in a specific format. After that, I created a parsing function to get all the main components of the instructions, that is the opcode, the register numbers and the immediate values. I input these results to a vector of instructions in which I use to start the program itself. After getting the instructions from the file, I ask the user to provide the required data and its address to memory.

I also have a main driver function that combines all these functions, initializes all data types, where it initializes the data structures that represent the instruction buffer, reorder buffer, reservation stations , memory and register file. This function is also responsible for a cycle by cycle output of results where it shows all changes happening in the mentioned most data structures above to allow for a better analysis of the results. It then outputs the total number of clock cycles, IPC and branch prediction if there is any.
